Subject: ANNOUNCE: Xpdf 2.02 - a PDF viewer for X


Glyph & Cog, LLC is pleased to announce a new version of Xpdf, the
open source Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer for X.  The Xpdf
project also includes a PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript
converter, and various other utilities.

Xpdf runs under the X Window System on Unix, VMS, and OS/2.  The non-X
components (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) also run on Win32 systems and
should run on pretty much any system with a decent C++ compiler.

Major changes:
* Rewrote the text extractor code that assembles words into lines to
  better handle vertically overlapping lines.
* Add the "match" option for paper size (in PostScript output).
* Added support for external 16-bit TrueType fonts; added the
  displayCIDFontTT and displayNamedCIDFontTT commands to the xpdfrc
  file.
* Added an Arabic language support package.
* Added the Windows-1255 encoding to the Hebrew language package.

See the `CHANGES' file for a complete list of changes.

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for UNIX, VMS, OS/2, and Win32.

More information, source code, and precompiled binaries are on the
xpdf web page and ftp site:
